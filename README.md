# Spacestagram

Welcome to Spacestagram! This project was built for Shopify's Winter 2022 Frontend Internship challenge. The deployed link for the application can be viewed [here](https://spacestagram-shopify-2728.herokuapp.com/)
This web application pulls from NASA's [Image and Video Library API](https://api.nasa.gov/) photos taken of the universe for viewers to "like" and "share"! The app was built with React and TypeScript using hooks for data fetching and component state management. 

## ⚡️ Quickstart
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed on your computer. From the command line:
```Bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone 
# Go to the repository
$ cd 
# Install package dependencies
$ yarn
```

In the project's root directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and is ready to be deployed!
